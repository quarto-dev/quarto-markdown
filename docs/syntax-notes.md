# Quarto Markdown Syntax

## Goals

We aim to be largely compatible with Pandoc's `markdown` and `Commonmark` formats.

## Syntax extensions

Syntax extensions are handled by [desugaring](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/Desugaring_as_a_Language_Feature.html) into regular Pandoc AST nodes.

### Shortcodes

We have "native" shortcode support in the "Pandoc" AST in pandoc.rs, and
we desugar them to Pandoc spans in a Rust filter.

### Notes

We parse footnotes differently from Pandoc.
We use NoteReference (Inline) and NoteDefinition (block) nodes.
These are desugared into spans and divs in a Rust filter.

### Reader raw blocks

Quarto Markdown supports the following syntax:

````
```{<pandoc}
| This will become a line block
| Line blocks are not supported by Quarto Markdown but
| can be supported via this fallback syntax
```
````

Reader raw blocks of the form `{<READER}` desugared into regular raw blocks of the form `{=pandoc-reader:READER}`.
This syntax effectively bypasses Quarto Markdown's syntax, and provides authors with an escape hatch into specific features in Pandoc readers.

## Pandoc syntax quirks

### Cites

Pandoc uses backtracking for its complex cite nodes, and puts strange content into the Cite node. 

Consider this:

```
$ echo '[prefix @c1 suffix; @c2; @c3]' | pandoc -t native
[ Para
    [ Cite
        [ Citation
            { citationId = "c1"
            , citationPrefix = [ Str "prefix" ]
            , citationSuffix = [ Space , Str "suffix" ]
            , citationMode = NormalCitation
            , citationNoteNum = 1
            , citationHash = 0
            }
        , Citation
            { citationId = "c2"
            , citationPrefix = []
            , citationSuffix = []
            , citationMode = NormalCitation
            , citationNoteNum = 1
            , citationHash = 0
            }
        , Citation
            { citationId = "c3"
            , citationPrefix = []
            , citationSuffix = []
            , citationMode = NormalCitation
            , citationNoteNum = 1
            , citationHash = 0
            }
        ]
        [ Str "[prefix"
        , Space
        , Str "@c1"
        , Space
        , Str "suffix;"
        , Space
        , Str "@c2;"
        , Space
        , Str "@c3]"
        ]
    ]
]
```

The content array has Str "[prefix" and Str "@c2;", but the citation entries correctly remove the semicolon and brackets.

Currently, we emit empty content for the Cite node.
The citation entries themselves are handled.

Pandoc "uses some heuristics to separate the locator from the rest of the subject".
Empirically, what this means is that one of the Str nodes inside the suffix has the entirety of (eg) "pp. 33".
We don't support that yet.

### Superscript

Superscript in `-f markdown` behaves sort of magically, and I think it involves backtracking. Consider:

```
$ echo 'a^a*a^a^a*a^a' | pandoc -t native
[ Para
    [ Str "a"
    , Superscript
        [ Str "a"
        , Emph [ Str "a" , Superscript [ Str "a" ] , Str "a" ]
        , Str "a"
        ]
    , Str "a"
    ]
]
```

How does it know to match the carets in the way it does? `-f commonmark+superscript` doesn't support this:

```
$ echo 'a^a*a^a^a*a^a' | pandoc -t native -f commonmark+superscript
[ Para
    [ Str "a"
    , Superscript [ Str "a*a" ]
    , Str "a"
    , Superscript [ Str "a*a" ]
    , Str "a"
    ]
]
```

This inconsistency gives me moral space for our parser to be inconsistent here as well.

### Line Blocks

tl;dr: Quarto Markdown will not support Pandoc LineBlock parsing.

Pandoc supports ["line blocks"](https://pandoc.org/demo/example33/8.6-line-blocks.html), syntax like this:

```
| The limerick packs laughs anatomical
| In space that is quite economical.
|    But the good ones I've seen
|    So seldom are clean
| And the clean ones so seldom are comical
```

The AST type is `LineBlock [[Inline]]` (each line in the line block is a list of `Inline`).
Unfortunately, this syntax interacts very badly with pipe tables under any fixed lookahead parsing strategy.
Consider:

- ```
  | This is a line block
  | No problem, right?
  ```

  This is a line block.

- ```
  | This is still a line block |
  | -
  ```

  This is a line block.

- ```
  | Oh, oh no |
  | - |
  ```
  
  This is a table.

Quarto Markdown is designed to be efficiently parseable (via `tree-sitter` grammars).
`tree-sitter` is (mostly) a LALR(1) parser, which means it needs to decide rules based on 1-token lookahead.
We don't see how to do distinguish pipe tables and line blocks with fixed lookahead.
We also don't see line blocks commonly used in the wild (they don't exist in CommonMark, for example).

### Definition lists

tl;dr: Quarto Markdown will not support Pandoc DefinitionList parsing.

Definition lists offer the same problem.
There's no way to know that the following construct isn't a paragraph followed by something else without parsing the entire paragraph first:

- ```
  A term
  
  :    a definition
  ```

  This is a definition list.

- ```
  A term
  ```

  This is a paragraph.

We will also not support definition lists directly.

### Superscript + note vs span ambiguity

Consider `^[footnote-or-span]{.class}^`. `^[` denotes both the start of a footnote and potentially the combination of a superscript block with a span; this parse is ambiguous.

Quarto-markdown's parser prefers the footnote interpretation. In case an immediately nested span is needed, use a space between `^` and `[`.
Superscript nodes with leading spaces are disallowed in Pandoc, but Quarto-markdown will trim spaces.
